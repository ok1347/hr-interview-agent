# 🎓 HR Interview Agent with Voice — Yahya KROMBI

This project is an intelligent HR agent that conducts job interviews with candidates, combining GPT-4o, Whisper (speech-to-text), and MeloTTS (text-to-speech) in a Streamlit interface.
Whisper may sometimes not pick up the best words from the audio, so it is better to talk clear into the mic, and also in english if possible XD.

## Features

- Upload and process candidate CV and job offer PDFs
- HR agent powered by GPT-4o and LangChain
- Candidate can **type or speak**
- Uses **Whisper API** to transcribe speech
- Agent responds in English, with voice using **MeloTTS** (It's the only one we could integrate with our small gpus :C)
- Fully local + OpenAI integration

## How to Run:

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```

### 2. Set your OpenAI key

Create a `.env` file inside `app/`:

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxx... #your_openai_key
```

### 3. Run the app


```bash
source hr_env/bin/activate
streamlit run test_app_novoice/app.py
```

## Notes

- Whisper transcription supports French, Arabic, English, etc.
- Agent always responds in **English** because MeloTTS for now we tested it on only english
- Voice output = MeloTTS (CPU-friendly, fast)
- Code handles real-time chat with memory
- Audio files are generated temporarily (`.wav`)
- We used WSL for this project (since we know you like working with Linux)
